# Scripts-for-Stuff

This is a repo to contain all of my miscellaneous scripts for things which aren't large enough for their own repository.

Below are the projects which are contained:

## [MC-Launcher-JS](MC-Launcher-JS) & [MC-Launcher-CPP](MC-Launcher-CPP)
- Two approaches to creating an updating script to launch the MC launcher keeping all modpack instances from curseforge as launch profiles.

## [Playlistinator](Playlistinator)
- A spotify playlist downloader that utilizes the SpotiPy API and a TouTube to MP3 library in order to download songs from a playlist.
- Does it still work after Google cracked down on 3rd party streaming? No clue.

## [Repo Merger](Repo%20Merger)
- The inspiration for this repo. It is used to clone and merge seperate repositories into one in the format seen here.
- The above projects were moved using this tool. Used to maintain development commits for existing projects. 
- Could this be done by hand? Yes? Is it faster using this? Yes?

## [RoR2DescriptionSwitch](RoR2DescriptionSwitch)
- This is a quick script to replace the item descriptions in Risk of Rain 2 with the ones from the logbook which provide additional detail into what the items do and how they stack.
