# MC-Launcher-cpp
Inital attempt to automate twitch launch and update of profiles.json for minecraft.

Rapidjson encounters some issues with looping, making it not scaleable.
I could take a different approach, either doing it manually without rapidjson,

OR

I could do it in javascript as it'll be easier and more linear.
