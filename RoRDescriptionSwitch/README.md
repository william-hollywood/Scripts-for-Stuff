# Ror2DescriptionSwitch
- This is a quick script to replace the item descriptions in Risk of Rain 2 with the ones from the logbook which provide additional detail into what the items do and how they stack.

Written in python, all this does is opens the Items and Equipment files and iterates over the lines and does some text replacement. Quick and dirty, made in 2 minutes.
